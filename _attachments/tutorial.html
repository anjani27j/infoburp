Welcome to infoburp.com. infoburp lets you create a diagram made of nodes and links. Nodes contain your ideas, and links connect them together, based on their relationships. You might know this as brainstorming or mind mapping, well infoburp is that idea done on the web. 

<-You can try out the force layout editor to the left, but your changes won't be saved. Once you login you will be given a private layout that only you can view.
