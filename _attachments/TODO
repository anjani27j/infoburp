a)infoburp uses couchdb as it's server, and is written as a couchapp,
this means as soon as a user accesses the site the software is
downloaded to their machine, and works even when their internet
connection is interrupted.

b)couchdb uses .json files natively, and these are also the standard
files that d3 accepts.

c)d3 is the chosen visualisation library. we need to add some new functionality.

d)I have chosen the force layout, we need to add:

1. HTML displayed inside the circular nodes.

2. A node content editor, when I click on a node, an editor pops out
to the right of the screen, allowing me to both view the content more
closely, and, if I own the node, to edit it's content.

3. The ability to freely create new links from node to node, by
dragging from one node to another. A line is displayed behind the
mouse when the mouse is dragged away from a node. Nodes cannot be
moved and are placed by d3.force.

3a. The ability to create new nodes, by dragging from one node to
empty space on the graph. The node lands where the user puts it, but
is immediately added to the force layout.

4. One .json file per node, and one per link, to allow the files to be
shared more easily between client and server, and accommodate large
numbers of nodes. nodes and links dynamically added to the user's
display.

5. infoburp packaged as a couchapp.

6. the ability to login using one of the four:

6a. yahoo
6b. twitter
6c. facebook
6d. google

7. couchdb as the storage and distribution method for both infoburp
itself and the data it presents to the user.

8. amazon adverts linked to relevant parent node.

9. the ability to pan and zoom the view.
9a. download the data onscreen on zoom/pan.
