<h1>describing a software system and building it should be the same thing.</h1>

put another way, the software, the manual to use it, the source code and the data should be on the same "disk", and they can be on the web.

<h3>the web gives us a platform for innovation. it is a huge resource, and there are many ways to look at the data that's online.

many people have described software systems that would be amazing if implemented.

could we make a way to describe a system in wysiHTML and interleave that description with JS code to make it work, CSS to make it look nice and SVG to make interactive visual interfaces?</h3>

<li>can a large number of people make interfaces?</li>

<li>can we share interfaces as pages on a wiki?</li>



<li>can we join the interfaces together into a graph?</li>

<li>can we link this to the semantic web and the web in general?</li>

<li>can we make a modelling clay interface that can be changed to suit our needs?</li>

<h3>these are the questions I am both asking and attempting to answer with <a href="http://infoburp.com">infoburp</a>.</h3>
