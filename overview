=== Infoburp overview ===

## Introduction ##

This document outlines the main goals and features of the Infoburp project - an interactive Semantic Web tool. In essential, Infoburp allows:

- To browse through data available in the Web;
- To manipulate these data by various methods;
- To contribute the user's own data interleaving with the Global infosphere;
- To represent the results in a highly interactive and easy to use way.

This can be best described by example.

Being a fan of Dmitry Hvorostovsky opera singer, I'd like to know what concert halls and opera houses Dmitry has visited throughout last years. I want to plot them as locations on the world map. And maybe, link one location to another, to display the path of Dmitry's travels. How can I accomplish this?

I can get world map from Wikipedia, Wolfram|Alpha, or Openstreetmap, and Hvorostovsky's travels are outlined in his Facebook page. But there isn't any clear way to interleave these data.

Here comes Infoburp. Using this tool, one can solve such problem in several easy steps.

1. Create a Facebook Connection block which links to Dmitry Hvorostovsky page and the list of his travels. Every item of this list is linked to a geographical location.
2. Connect it to a OpenStreetMap block. The geographical locations data are displayed on world map, and it's just the result we were looking for.

Another example.
