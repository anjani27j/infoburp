By
adding an idea to infoburp, you agree to share that idea under the
terms of the GPL. <br>
<br>
I mainly created infoburp to see something interesting that had not
been done before, for that reason the database I am hosting to show off
infoburp (this site, infoburp.com) is completely GPL licenced, in
addition the infoburp client is GPL licensed, and the software that
infoburp is hosted on is GPL licensed.<br>
<br>
That means that all of the ideas on infoburp are free as in speech, and
as a group we can create something interesting without worrying too
much about, or violating, copyright laws, and other restrictions on the
open expression of ideas.<br>
<br>
By adding an idea to infoburp.com, you agree to allow anyone:<br>
<br>
the freedom to use the idea for any purpose,<br>
the freedom to change the idea to suit their needs,<br>
the freedom to share the idea with their friends and neighbors,<br>
and the freedom to share the changes they make<span

<br>

<br>
If you want to make private infoburps, you can of course do this, but
this will involve downloading the infoburp source yourself and
tinkering around a little bit.<br>
