<li><h1>describing a software system and building it are the same thing.</h1></li>

<li><h2>the web gives us a platform for innovation. it is a huge resource, and there are many ways to look at the data.</h2></li>

<li><h1>many people have described software systems that would be amazing if implemented.</h1></li>

<li><h1>could we make a way to describe a system in wysiHTML and interleave that description with JS code to make it work, CSS to make it look nice and SVG to make interactive visual interfaces?</h1></li>

<li>can we share interfaces as pages on a wiki?</li>

<li>can a large number of people make interfaces?</li>

<li>can we join the interfaces together into a graph?</li>

<li>can we link this to the semantic web and the web in general?</li>

<li>can we make a modelling clay interface that can be changed to suit our needs?</li>

<li>these are the questions I am both asking and attempting to answer with infoburp.</li>
