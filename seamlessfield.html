<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/infoburp/infoburp">github.com/infoburp/infoburp (Get the GPL licensed source code for infoburp)</a><h1>

<h2>I know for a fact that infoburp runs on Debian GNU/linux in Google Chrome browser. Your results //may *will vary.</h2>

<h3>This document outlines the main goals and features of the infoburp project - an interactive Semantic Web tool, and is interactive in parts to illustrate the points discussed. I have mostly marked these out with *interactive so you know where to click, and it's all reset back to normal after you press F5, so have a try. In essence, infoburp allows the user:</h3>
<ul>
<li> To browse through data available in the Web;</li>
<li> To manipulate these data by various methods;</li>
<li> To contribute the user's own data interleaving with the Global infosphere;</li>
<li> To represent the results in a highly interactive and easy to use way.</li>
<li> Everything is inside linked nodes.</li>
<li> Nodes can contain other nodes, links, data, repurposable widgets, like buttons, knobs, sliders and tick and textboxes, and others can contain visualisations, still other nodes contain headless js with the links denoting the data/program flow.</li>
<li> Every node has a URI. </li>
<li> Any node can link to any other node it knows the URI for.</li>
<li> In this way we can "plumb" programs and data together and build interesting custom interfaces referencing the data available (the WWW), and easily share the resulting customised interface with anyone online in a single hyperlink(back onto the WWW).</li>
<li> Everything is editable, including the editors.</li>
<li> The whole thing is a wysiwiki, so viewing and editing are in the same interface, and saving is as far as possible done without user intervention.</li>
<li> Any thing on the WWW (i.e. with a URI), can be added as a node.</li>
<li> Every interface is contained inside it's own node, and every interface is editable, to change the way it edits other nodes.</li>
<li> The interface is a fractal, it contains at it's simplest level just one node, that contains all that infoburp is aware of, and larger numbers of nodes inside the master node nested and by topic and relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Examples </h2>

This can be best described by example.

Being a fan of Dmitry Hvorostovsky opera singer, I'd like to know what concert halls and opera houses Dmitry has visited throughout last years. I want to plot them as locations on the world map. And maybe, link one location to another, to display the path of Dmitry's travels. How can I accomplish this?

I can get world map from Wikipedia, Wolfram|Alpha, or Openstreetmap, and Hvorostovsky's travels are outlined in his Facebook page. But there isn't any clear way to interleave these data.

Here comes infoburp. Using this tool, one can solve such problem in several easy steps.
<ol>
<li>Create a Facebook Connection node which links to Dmitry Hvorostovsky page and the list of his travels. Every item of this list is linked to a geographical location.
<li>Connect it to a OpenStreetMap node. The geographical locations data are displayed on world map in a node, and it's just the result we were looking for.
</ol>
<h2>Development progress</h2>
Now let's look at the development progress so far on infoburp in a series of screenshots and mockup images created over the last few months (in time order except the little interactive bits which are quite new), and more live examples towards the end<br>
above each image is the question that lead to considering the option depicted in the image.<br>

<h3>What is?</h3>
infoburp is/will be an interactive/reactive mind mapper that runs in your web browser, and it's also my (gwolfendale@gmail.com), and a few other people's (join in on github by [fork]ing infoburp/infoburp) sandbox for playing with HTML,CSS and JS together with semantic technologies.
