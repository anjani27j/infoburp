<h1>describing a software system and building it should be the same thing.</h1>

put another way, the software, the manual to use it, the source code and the data should be on the same page, and they can be on the web. the web gives us a platform for innovation. it is a huge resource, and there are many ways to look at the data that's online. many people have described software systems that would be amazing if implemented. could we make a way to describe a system in wysiHTML and interleave that description with JS code to make it work, CSS to make it look nice and SVG to make interactive visual interfaces?can a large number of people make interfaces?can we share interfaces as pages on a wiki?can we join the interfaces together into a graph?can we link this to the semantic web and the web in general?can we make a modelling clay interface that can be changed to suit our needs?
