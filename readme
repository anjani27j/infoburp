how to setup a testing server:

1) Install xampp apache friends from: http://www.apachefriends.org
2) Copy htdocs from the dropbox to your xampp installation htdocs (e.g. /opt/lampp/htdocs)
3) Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/, add a database called infoburp,
   and import /opt/lampp/htdocs/infoburp.sql
4) Go to http://localhost using google chrome or similar modern browser

DONE

	Project is going well, we need to keep on track and work to this file and the
	infoburp software development spreadsheet, shared on google docs (make sure
	that you have this, and check it regularly).

	-Laid out the future structure of infoburp 1.0 in /js

	-We need to make node, bubble, link positions relative, to allow faster display
	 of available nodes,links and bubbles, a typical subset of the entire graph.
	 The only node with a fixed position is node0, which is always at position(0,0)
	 in the centre of the graph.

	We need to discuss coding regulations. coding style, etc.. possibly variable
	and function names, tabulating, etc..
	
	I recommend sublime code editor instead of notepad++, it's smoother, and better
	dark themes. all around the best i've seen. you can download at www.sublimetext.com/2

	Moved params for nodes and all other config params into config.js
	6/24
		server side: made nodes and links load into separate flat lists
		client side: js/action.js: sorted all functions to load from get() and post()
		client side: js/*.js: made loading functions consitently named(load())
		client side: js/load.js: made nodes and links load into separate flatlists( IB._nodes & IB._links )
		[in progress]client side: js/create.js: made nodes and links create from flatlist instead of tree
