"PUT OUT GOES! (GPL3) +have HTML5 in them +slammers edit linked2 +drag pog 2copy +click pog 2slam.if we don't know? now we know. infoburp!com"=140chars :)

this is the outline of a slammer

URL - where?
HTML - what?
CSS - look?
JS - how?
SVG - interface?
JSON/RDF - linked?

I want to make 2 slammers to start with:

(+) (-)

That do easy to understand things to true/false (up/down,more/less,add/take,left/right,in/out,read/write) inputs and have the symbol on their face so you know what they do:

(+) adds the input pogs and outputs the result      -(false - not bigger than (0)) or an overflow (true - bigger than (0))
(-) subtracts the input pogs and outputs the result - (false - smaller than (0)) or an overflow (true - bigger than (0))

And 3 pogs:

(-1)(0)(+1)

That are the trinary seed numbers

a pog is just a less "thick" slammer, the simplest case described above, slammers and pogs are each one char -1,0,1,+,-

Because of the nature of mathematics + fractals, we can combine these simple slams into interesting, medium slammers, then make even bigger slammers containing these medium slammers and so on.

These 4 functions should be enough to do everything, once we can link and stack them in this way

A Turing machine (slammer) is a device that manipulates symbols (pogs) on a strip (link) of tape (takes in pogs and uses JS to modify them) according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can be adapted to simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly useful in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer.

infoburp is a giant global graph of pogs on tape and slammers on tape, and hyperlinks are the strips of tape zipping through slammers. not your parent's cassette player/VCR, but similar enough.

a tweetypog is 140 chars of HTML,CSS,RDF,JS,JSON or SVG that's not much good on it's own but can be sent over twitter and later combined with other pogs to make cool stuff.
