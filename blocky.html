blocky

there are rectangular "blocks" with attribute size(x,y) in an arrangement on the graph alongside pogs.

you can link one iframe to another by tagging it on to the edge of another.

the shape of the edge represents the ouput data type or the expected input type.

you can copy an block in one of the four n(out)e(in).s(in)w(out) directions.

each block can output pixels to its "face", the area it occupies. it's like a square pog/slammer.
